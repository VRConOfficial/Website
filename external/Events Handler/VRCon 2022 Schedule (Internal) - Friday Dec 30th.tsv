1:00 PM 		40k Combat Sneak Peek	1	We will be showing off the Avatar PvP system (which is a Avatar Particles based combat system) and presenting how our Network of Groups utilise this for Events.  We will decide on a open door activity depending on spectators present at the event (These could range from simple 1v1 on low attendance to a bigger "Battle" if we have more people). For the purpose of this event we will need all attendents (only if they wish to partake) to do a few things so that the system may work:  - Turn Shield Level to "None" (this is required since the damage is emitted by Avatars)  - Turn off Particle Limits (to make sure all Damage Registers)  - Have participants clone compatible Avatar's (these will be provided by us)  A quick introduction of the system will be given to all before we start (things like latency are part of VRChat and will be explained here as an example)	A open door Showcase of the true Chaos of replicating the 40k Setting and it's ridiculous weaponry in the form of Avatar based PvP!

No, we likely don't require much more outside of having it made clear that people are happily invited to test out the system and our avatars and the things mentioned above if it is agreeable.
