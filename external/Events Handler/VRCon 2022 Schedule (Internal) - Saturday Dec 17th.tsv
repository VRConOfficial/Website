1:00 PM 		Mental Health & VRC	1	In this panel, I'll be discussing how VRC can impede or affect mental health-- including the appeal of the game to neurodivergent people. We'll also touch base on how VRC affects substance abuse. Why do second life games appeal to the escapist in all of us? What drives the mind to relish the versatility VRChat provides?	VRChat is a platform that appeals to many users-- but there are a significant number who are neruodivergent. Why do those with 'special needs' find this game so appealing? Join us for a deep dive into mental health and how it correlates to VRChat.	nerdynanny	nerdynanny	None	Panel/Talk	1 Hour	None	https://www.twitch.tv/nerdynanny	VRCon Provided	None	TRUE	https://www.twitch.tv/nerdynanny	NO Media. 1-2 cams							I can do the panel anywhere from 30 mins to an hour.
