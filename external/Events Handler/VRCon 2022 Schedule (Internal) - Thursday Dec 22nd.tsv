2:00 PM 		Daily Lives of a Soldier	2	The Event will be a simple guide/tour through one of our maps while our people do their daily roleplay. People can observe and watch what we do on our daily base. We will have one person guiding them around and explain them what this is all about and what exactly we do.	The life of a solider is a lot more than just combat and operations, the average Waifuwehr soldier only spends 3-4 hours a week in the field operating. Ever wondered what the life of a solider is like the rest of the time? What the life of a solider is actually like? Come and check it out with our Daily Lives of Soldiers event! See our bases, our troops in their natural habitat and have a good time!

5:00 PM 		The Ocean isn't Scary	1	This event would be a talk about the ocean to help spread awareness and debunk common myths and misunderstandings of the ocean, while still creating a comedic and fun experience for those watching. Going through different myths as well as certain fears many may have about the ocean and it's ecosystem, in the hopes to make others more aware of what is actually down their and to possibly help relieve some of the fears they may have once had.  This event, while still being informative, will share my own experiences and stories in a comedic light. Topics relating to thalassophobia and shark attacks will be present.	We are all scared of the ocean, but maybe we don't have to be? Kira shares their experience with the ocean and why it's not as scary as we may think!
